# owlweather
Owl with moving eyes and electronic barometer/weather forecasting<br/>
![owlmoving](https://github.com/shakso/owlweather/blob/master/owlanim.gif?raw=true)

This project is pretty custom with not a lot of stuff that could potentially be used elsewhere - either way, I've decided to put the code on Github.

Below is a summary of the files used:
* arduino/owlWeather.ino - main sketch that is uploaded to the ESP8266
* arduino/owlHTML.htm - de-minified version of the Owl main webpage
* arduino/owlWeather.pdf - background image used
* nodejs/updateOwl.js - scheduled script that sends new weather information to Owl
